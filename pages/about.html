    <h1>About JobPulse Kolkata</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <span id="dt"></span></p>

    <p><strong>JobPulse Kolkata</strong> is an independent, fast and distraction-free site focused on <strong>West Bengal jobs, exams, and admit card/result updates</strong>. We aggregate official announcements and trusted job portals via RSS, then rewrite and reformat them so they’re easier to scan on mobile. Our goal is simple: help candidates in Kolkata and across WB discover relevant vacancies quickly and apply at the official source.</p>

    <h2>What we publish</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Government jobs (WBPSC, WB Police, Health, Education, Panchayat, etc.)</li>
      <li>Bank & Rail updates relevant to candidates in West Bengal</li>
      <li>Private and IT openings located in WB or remote roles open to WB residents</li>
      <li>Exam dates, admit cards, results, and official notices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we curate content</h2>
    <p>We monitor multiple trusted sources using RSS feeds and official websites. Each item is <strong>rewritten</strong> to avoid duplication and to add value—clear headings, important dates, eligibility and application steps. We always link back to the <strong>official website</strong> so candidates can verify details and apply safely.</p>

    <h2>Quality & transparency</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No paywall</strong>: the website is free to access.</li>
      <li><strong>Source links</strong>: every post includes the source URL where possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Corrections</strong>: if something looks wrong, <a href="/pages/contact.html">contact us</a> and we’ll fix it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Revenue & ads</h2>
    <p>We use Google AdSense for basic display ads. Ads help us keep the site free and maintain hosting. We don’t sell personal data; see our <a href="/pages/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Our promise</h2>
    <p>We keep the UI clean, fast and accessible. Features like dark mode, live ticker, auto-scrolling lists, “Save Job”, weather/clock widgets and an exam calendar are designed to make browsing efficient without getting in your way.</p>

    <h2>Get in touch</h2>
    <p>We welcome feedback and new feed suggestions. Please reach out via the <a href="/pages/contact.html">Contact page</a>.</p>
